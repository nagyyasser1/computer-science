_________ Big O notaion _________

"How code slows as data grows"

-> 1. Describes the performance of an algorithm as the amount of data increases.
-> 2. Machine independent (# of steps to completion).
-> 3> Ignore smaller operations O(n+1) -> O(n)

*example:    n = amount of data 
             (it's a variable like x )
O(1) = constant time
       - random access of an element in an array.
       - inserting at the beginning of linkedlist.
O(n)   linear time
O(log n)
O(n^2)
